This is to indiate the flags - 200 OK etc.


public ResponseEntity<studentDto> getByID(@PathVariable int id)


1.  return ResponseEntity.status(HttpStatus.OK).body(studentService.getAll());

2.  return ResponseEntity.ok(studentService.getByID(id));

3.  return ResponseEntity.noContent().build();   ------ this is mainly used in delete when the operation as taken place but there is nothing to return.
