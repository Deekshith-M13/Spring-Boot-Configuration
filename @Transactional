@Transactional makes sure your work with the database is done like a perfect deal — either everything happens, or nothing happens — keeping your database safe and consistent.



🧩 Spring Boot Transaction Summary
🔹 What is a Transaction?

A transaction is a group of database operations that must either all succeed or all fail —
ensuring atomicity, consistency, and data safety.

➡️ If all steps succeed: changes are committed
➡️ If any step fails: all changes are rolled back

🔹 What is @Transactional?

@Transactional is a Spring annotation that tells Spring:

“Run everything in this method as one single transaction.”

Spring then:

Starts a transaction

Opens a Persistence Context (a temporary in-memory workspace)

Runs your DB operations

If everything is fine → commit

If any error occurs → rollback

🔹 Persistence Context

Managed by Hibernate (JPA provider).

Acts like a notebook or cache that holds all entities currently being worked on.

When you modify an entity, changes happen inside this context, not directly in the database.

At the end of the transaction, Hibernate synchronizes it with the real database.

🔹 Dirty Checking

Hibernate automatically tracks changes made to entities in the Persistence Context.

When the transaction commits, it checks (“dirty checks”) for differences between:

Entities in memory

Entities in the database

If differences exist → Hibernate automatically issues the necessary UPDATE, INSERT, or DELETE SQL.

✅ You don’t need to manually call save() again.

🔹 Commit & Rollback
Action	Description
Commit	Transaction completes successfully → Hibernate flushes all updates to the database permanently
Rollback	Transaction fails → Hibernate discards all changes in the Persistence Context → database stays unchanged
🔹 Analogy
Concept	Analogy
Transaction	Like a deal — all steps succeed or the deal is cancelled
@Transactional	The manager ensuring the deal completes properly
Persistence Context	Your working notebook or Git workspace
Dirty Checking	Like git diff – detects what changed
Commit	Like git commit – saves changes permanently
Rollback	Like git reset --hard – undo all changes
🔹 In Simple Words

@Transactional ensures your database operations happen safely and atomically.
Hibernate keeps your data changes in memory (Persistence Context),
checks what changed (Dirty Checking),
and only writes them to the database when the transaction commits.
If an error occurs, all those temporary changes are discarded (Rollback).
